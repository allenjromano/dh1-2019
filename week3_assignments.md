Beyond these pieces, peruse both editions and find at least one piece that you think your peers should read. Come prepared to pitch its value to your classmates during class. 

## Lab

Unlike the readings, which are meant to prepare for a discussion, the lab component of the course is meant to *review* and *extend* what we did in the previous class. The resources and exercises below are ways to practice what you looked at this week. 

1. Set up your desktop environment. (See instructions [here]().)
2. Read and try to apply the methods in any or all of the following resources:

[_Data Science at the Command Line_](https://www.datascienceatthecommandline.com/)
Chapters 1 and 3 especially for this past week

[Basic text analysis at the command line](https://williamjturkel.net/2013/06/15/basic-text-analysis-with-command-line-tools-in-linux/)

3. Try to apply what we did in class to your own data. Choose a text that is of interest, find the text file or, if there is no readily accessible .txt file, use any lab hours this week to come into the dhlab and work through how to get the text that you're interested in into digital form.
