[And as follow up from talking about storymaps: https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/story-maps/sharing-collaboration/story-maps-and-the-digital-humanities/] (Links to an external site.)

Mapping is yet another topic that demands its own course. A good online resource is http://fredgibbs.net/courses/digital-mapping/

Lab:

1. As background, read http://stat405.had.co.nz/ggmap.pdf (Links to an external site.)

2. Basic maps: https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-plot-basic-maps-with-ggmap/ (Links to an external site.)

3. Try the qmap method: https://blog.dominodatalab.com/geographic-visualization-with-rs-ggmaps/ (Links to an external site.)

4. [This is somewhat longer. Read and, if you have time, try to replicate]: Chapter 2 of Geocomputation with R: https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-class.html (Links to an external site.)



Extended techniques:

You can connect plot.ly to ggmap (through ggplot2): https://plot.ly/ggplot2/interactive-tooltip/ (Links to an external site.)

A fairly concise but full overview of methods, including an introduction to dealing with shape data: http://data-analytics.net/cep/Schedule_files/geospatial.html (Links to an external site.)



Further reading:

If  you want to go above and beyond, check out https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/intro-spatial-rl.pdf (Links to an external site.)

For GIS and such, there is a book: https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/  (Links to an external site.)

See chapter 9: https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/gis.html (Links to an external site.)





Reference: There are numerous resources that help you understand the vastness that is geographic data in R (and transferable to other domains).

For an overview of various packages that deal with spatial data (and what you can do with them), see https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html (Links to an external site.)
