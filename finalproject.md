# Final Project Steps

For the final project in the course, you are asked to go through the OSEMN steps on a dataset of your choosing. That means:

1. *O*btain your data: This should be fairly self-explanatory

2. *S*crub your data: Use openrefine or other workflows to clean your data. There are a number of video clips to help you with scrubbing your data. 

3. *E*xplore your data: Use R do do an initial sweep through your data, similar to what we did with the carets and mpg datasets. You can use R and you can also use the command line tool visidata: [https://visidata.org/](https://visidata.org/). This is where you produce statistics and visualizations based on those statistics. Look for patterns both through the numbers and through the visualizations.

4. *M*odel your data: This is where you use machine learning, data mining, or other predictive tools to see the patterns in your data. For text, this may involve text mining or Bayesian classification. For other types of data it may be categorical classification or prediction.

5. I*N*terpret your data: Tell a story about your data. What does it all mean?

Go through each step and write up your results and findings for each step. Include visualizations and images as appropriate. You should present your findings as an R markdown notebook. You have the option of porting this notebook to a reveal.js presentation, a pdf, a webpage, or another form of interactive output. See the separate page on [presenting R documents](presentationTools) for suggestions.
