# Week 7

# Reading
This week (and in subsequent weeks) our readings will more heavily be about R and about programming and analysis. 

# Lab
The lab portion involves working on code in R in three stages: 1) following an online or book set of hands-on tutorials to learn new functions, methods, etc., then 2) spending no more than 1 hour applying those functions and methods to a different data set, either one of interest to you or one from the pool of faculty data in need of analysis, and, at any point, 3) looking into the help documentation and online documentation around particular functions and methods to make sure you understand how each works.

Review and try on your own data: chapter 3, Data Visualization, from Wickham and Grolemund: [https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html)

*New stuff*

# Additional resources

Reminder that there are many many tools to help you learn R. A few that you should consider:

[Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/): both free and paid R tutorials. It is not cheap, but this is an excellent investment. I highly recommend you use this to supplement what we do in class. Note that the site also has lessons and curriculum on python, sql, and a host of other tools that you may want to learn.  

[R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/): for all things R, I highly suggest you check in regularly at R-bloggers. It will give you a sense of the range of things going on with the language and you will often see tutorials of interest there. 

[Rseek](https://rseek.org/): search engines will usually get you want you want, but given that "R" is such a generic search term, there is a special search engine (just a customized google search) to return results related to R the language rather than other random things that might come up with the letter 'r'.
