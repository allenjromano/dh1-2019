## Lab

This week was primarily concerned with Regular Expressions, git, markdown, and getting ready to use R. 

*Git*

Make sure your github or gitlab site is set up and ready to go and that you can commit and push to your repository from whatever environment you are working in. 

*Regular Expressions*
Read [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4736/learning-regular-expressions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4736/learning-regular-expressions)

Try to build more complex regular expressions with regexr [https://regexr.com/](https://regexr.com/) that search your dataset for patterns. 

Alternatively, you can use [https://regex101.com/](https://regex101.com/) or any similar site. They have the same basic functionality.

*Command Line*
Find a favorite command or two from [commandlinefu](https://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/browse) and bring it to class next week.
