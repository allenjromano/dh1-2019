## Schedule

Each class session will be divided into two parts. The first part of our time will usually be devoted to discussion, projects, and activities in digital humanities. The second part will be more of a lab session where we will build a technical repertoire. 

There will be a set of readings and projects to look at in advance of class, and then activities (primarily technical) to do after class in order to practice and become familiar with techniques demonstrated during class. The schedule will therefore regularly indicate before class, during class, and after class. Listed below are the technical topics for each week. Readings in dh will correspond in various ways with these methods and areas.

## Assignments

The primary work of this course involves 1) before each class, reading secondary scholarship in digital humanities and viewing digital humanities projects online, 2) during each class, participating and engaging fully in all activities and work, and 3) after each class and before the next class, practicing the previous week's work through completing the weekly "lab". In addition, all students will complete a project of their own which takes some set of data through all the stages of OSEMN (Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, Interpret) and will complete at least 2 of the real-world challenges offered by faculty working on current dh projects. 

## Assignment Submission

In the first two weeks of the class, as we set up your working environment, we will also set up an online repository where you will post your work. You will need to make that repository visible to me, at a minimum (we will go through the steps). 


## Grading

This is a graduate course. It is expected that students come to all classes well prepared and participate fully in all activities. Though there is a grading scheme outlined below, there are, in effect, really only three grades appropriate to graduate students. Work will either be acceptable (in which case, a B+), better than acceptable (an A), or not acceptable (a C). No student in this class should do work that receives any grade other than acceptable or better than acceptable. 

You will be graded on each of the following areas. All are weighted equally (i.e. 25% each) in determining the final grade.

1. Completion of readings before class and full participation in classwork
2. Completion of "labs" to practice skills learned during class each week
3. Completion of at least 2 of the real-world problems/challenges posted in the dhlab
4. Completion of a project on your own data

There is no midterm and no final exam for this course.
