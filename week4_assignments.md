## Lab

Unlike the readings, which are meant to prepare for a discussion, the lab component of the course is meant to *review* and *extend* what we did in the previous class. The resources and exercises below are ways to practice what you looked at this week. 

[Openrefine](http://openrefine.org/):

0. Optional: Install openrefine on your own computer. Note that you will need a working Java installation, usually the Java Development Kit (jdk) or Java Runtime Environment (jre). Come by Diff 421 for help troubleshooting the installation if it doesn't work.

1. Try with sample data: Using Openrefine, take a look at these dante tweets [dantetweets.csv, link to canvas, requires login](https://fsu.instructure.com/courses/97324/files?preview=5869395)

Your tasks:
- get a feel for the data. Explore it and see what features of it are perhaps worth studying

- Clean the data. For each column see if you can normalize misspellings as appropriate. See if you can standardize the dates. See what other features of this dataset need cleaning and wrangling.

2. Try to wrangle your own data: Using openrefine, grab data relevant to your own area(s) of interest. See if you can clean it and get it ready for further analysis.
