# Week 2 Assignments
Complete before Tuesday 9/3

## Readings
[History of Humanities Computing](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405103213/9781405103213.xml&chunk.id=ss1-2-1)

[The Emergence of Digital Humanities](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9780203093085): read Introduction, Chapter 1, Chapter 7. (all other chapters are optional.)

**Old projects**: Take a look at some of the oldest projects in Digital Humanities. As you do, think especially about what the project is doing, what its aims seem to be, how well it serves those aims, what features it has, etc. 

[The Perseus project](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/)

[The Whitman Archive](https://whitmanarchive.org/)

[The Women's Writer Project](https://wwp.northeastern.edu/)

[The William Blake Archive](http://www.blakearchive.org/)

When such projects have history or about pages, make sure to read those as you peruse the various functions and parts of the sites. 

**Journals**
As part of our work we will also each week look at a journal or publication in digital humanities, both as a way of introducing you to the field and as a way to allow you to explore your own interests in the secondary literature. For this first week, you are asked to look at the [current issue of Digital Humanities Quarterly](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/13/1/index.html). Read at least one article that interests you. Feel free to peruse back issues, search for topics of interest, etc. Spend a minimum of a half hour. (You can of course spend many hours doing this if you find things that interest you.) You may also want to look at the [preview issue](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/preview/index.html) as that one is from a conference at FSU.

## Lab 
There is no lab assignment for this week, as we are just getting started. Rather, try out the USB stick on your own machine. If you run into any problems, then stop by the lab for troubleshooting. 

*Optional*

Once you've booted up your usb and logged in with your username and password that you set up, play around with the commands we saw briefly: `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`. 

If you're feeling adventurous, then try working a bit with `nano`. 

If you'd like to do a bit more before next week with this, you can learn a bit more about the command line by checking out the [command line tutorial course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) (free) at Codeacademy. 

Or, you might find the [programming historian](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-bash) useful. 

Or you can check out the [command line book (also free!) online](http://linuxcommand.org/). 

And... if you're feeling exceptionally adventurous and want to experience the glory (and sometimes pain) of a modal text editor, then try [vim]( https://www.openvim.com/). To get it operating on your system, type sudo pacman -S vim

Once it is installed, type vim to start it. You will not be in Kansas anymore.
