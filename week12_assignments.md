### Reading
**Read the following:**

1. Digital Geography and Classics: [http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/1/000031/000031.html](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/1/000031/000031.html)


2. What is Spatial History? [https://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/pub.php?id=29](https://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/pub.php?id=29)

**Review as many of the following projects as you have time for:**

Digital Mapping Pompeii: [http://digitalhumanities.umass.edu/pbmp/](http://digitalhumanities.umass.edu/pbmp/)

Digital Atlas Religion: http://religionatlas.org/ 

Geohumanities: http://geohumanities.org/ 

Spatial Humanities @UVA: http://spatial.scholarslab.org/ 

Stanford Spatial Histories: https://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/index.php 

San francisco streets: http://sfstreets.noahveltman.com/ 

Invasion of America: http://usg.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=eb6ca76e008543a89349ff2517db47e6 

 

Optional:

GIS and literary history: http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/1/000283/000283.html 

https://breac.nd.edu/articles/visualizing-a-spatial-archive-gis-digital-humanities-and-relational-space/ 

[And as follow up from talking about storymaps: https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/story-maps/sharing-collaboration/story-maps-and-the-digital-humanities/] 

Mapping is yet another topic that demands its own course. A good online resource is http://fredgibbs.net/courses/digital-mapping/

### Lab:

1. For an overview of various packages that deal with spatial data (and what you can do with them), see https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html 

   Keep tabs on new stuff at https://www.r-spatial.org/

2. As background, read http://stat405.had.co.nz/ggmap.pdf 

3. Basic maps: https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-plot-basic-maps-with-ggmap/ 

4. Try the qmap method: https://blog.dominodatalab.com/geographic-visualization-with-rs-ggmaps/ 

5. [This is somewhat longer. Read and, if you have time, try to replicate]: Chapter 2 of Geocomputation with R: https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-class.html 

Note: If you would like to replicate the methods here you will likely need to get a google api key. You can sign up for a key at https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key. Though it requires you to have a billing account, but your usage will be so minimal that it is without charge.

As an alternative/complement to google maps, you can access openstreetmap data with the overpass api: http://rpubs.com/hrbrmstr/overpass



Extended techniques:

You can connect plot.ly to ggmap (through ggplot2): https://plot.ly/ggplot2/interactive-tooltip/ 

A fairly concise but full overview of methods, including an introduction to dealing with shape data: http://data-analytics.net/cep/Schedule_files/geospatial.html



Further reading:

If  you want to go above and beyond, check out https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/intro-spatial-rl.pdf 

For GIS and such, there is a book: https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/  

See chapter 9: https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/gis.html
