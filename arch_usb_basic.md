# How to Build the Arch Linux USB (Basic instructions)

## Overview
This method is used to create a bootable and persistant USB running Arch Linux. The first part of the instructions are taken from http://valleycat.org/linux/arch-usb.html, though abbreviated in some respects. (If you are interested you should see the full instructions there.) 

The second part of the instructions install a set of utilities and basic tools to make a fully functional but extremely lightweight environment for working with various sorts of humanities data. 

To build out a more robust version of this same concept, see the instructions for the Extended Installation. 


## Make the Arch USB
(0. If you don't have a working copy of Arch linux, as on the lab computers or on the provided USB drives, then you will have to get one. You need to be working in an Arch environment before you follow any of the steps below.)

1. *Get a USB flash drive*
- You will need a flash drive to serve as the home for your Arch setup. I recommend going with the fastest (USB 3.0, _not_ 2.0) and largest drive you can get for about $10-$12. You can typically find a 64GB USB 3.0 drive on sale for about this amount (as of Fall 2019); these prices seem regularly to drop. Do not cheap out on a 2.0 drive, as the slow speed is not worth saving a few dollars. You do not need massive storage space unless you plan on carting around particularly large files (not generally recommended). 
- Note that everything on the drive will be erased
- If you do reuse an existing flash drive, make sure that there is nothing on there you ever want to get back again. It will be gone forever.
2. *Prepare the USB drive*

   

3. *Format the USB*
