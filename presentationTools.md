# Presentation Tools



Web technologies are the focus of the DH2 class. The resources below are provided as starting points for you as you consider what you might do in presenting the findings of your analysis and your projects. You might want to try out the tool of your choosing as a test run for an output format for your analysis and data.

1. Slides and presentations: Powerpoint is so 1998.

Presentation software is varied and copious. You have already seen, at least briefly, that any R notebook can be turned into a presentation. Here you can see the full extent of the flexibility of that system.

RStudio has multiple options for notebooks and their output formats for slides. You can export as ioslides, as reveal.js and others. The book you want for this is https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/ 

See especially the sections on presentations: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/presentations.html and, for revealjs, https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/revealjs.html 

revealjs is a particularly powerful tool. You can try it out in its implementation online at https://slides.com.



2. Beyond markdown: Bookdown

Perhaps you want to write an online book? The full guide is here: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/

Most all of the online books about R that you have read were composed using some combination of R markdown and/or this specific bookdown package. It is easy to get started and see how it works.

It can output into html, ebooks, pdf, and such:

You can "publish" your R results and code directly from R as a book: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/rstudio-connect.html 



3. Shiny

Start by checking out the gallery: https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/

You can guess that this is a much more involved process than simply extracting your R notebook as html or pdf or a slides presentation. However, there is a lot you can do with this. You can, for example, build an entirely interactive website with R in the back in order to present your research.

The tutorials at RStudio are quite good: https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/ 

I have found helpful the following tutorials which take you from setting up a cloud server instance (on digital ocean or on linode) all the way through setting up your shiny app running on your server.

For those taking the DH2 class, using Shiny could be a good thing to plan on working with next semester.
