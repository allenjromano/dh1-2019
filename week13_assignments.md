### Optional

Bibliometrics: The quantative study of citation and relationships of citation
In addition to social networks like twitter or data that involves families and group relationships, another domain of data ripe for network analysis is citation data. Such methods are useful in any discipline, as they provide a way to study the history of scholarship around particular issues or to see trends in scholarship. 

The R package for doing this sort of work is bibliometrix:
[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bibliometrix/vignettes/bibliometrix-vignette.html](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bibliometrix/vignettes/bibliometrix-vignette.html)

You can use the networkPlot function in bibliometrix to create a network graph based on your bibliometric data. [https://rdrr.io/cran/bibliometrix/man/networkPlot.html](https://rdrr.io/cran/bibliometrix/man/networkPlot.html)

(as one of many examples, see http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/2/000255/000255.html)
